Server normally returns HTML,but can return another things.

REST API
It's a way of thingking about how a web server responds to your requests.
It doesn't resond with just data
It responds with resources

RESOURCES
Similar to object-oriented programming
Think of the server as having resources, and each is able to interact with 
the pertinent request.

GET /item/chair
POST /item/chair (with extra data)
PUT /item/chair (WITH EXTRA DATA)
DELETE /item/chair

GET /items  <-Retrieves multiple items.

STATELESS
Another key feature is that REST is supposed to be stateless.
This means one request cannot depend on any other requests.
The server only knows about the current request, and not any previoius request.

Example:
POST /item/chair creates an item

- The server does not know the item now exists but is it in the DDBB.

GET /item/chair then goes to the DDBB and checks to see if the item is there.

To get an item you do not need to have created an item before -- the item could be
in the DDBB from previously.

The web application must send enough data to identify the user in every request, or
else the server won't associate the request with the user.
